# Intro to Machine Learning course

This class was more math intensive than I expected. That's probably one of the closest tastes I have ever gotten to being a math student *with all of the proofs in Linear Algebra and Statistics from scratch. Interesting stuff*. 


***Thanks Prof. Lytkin for reminding us how math might be important. And for showing how fancy LaTeX is***
